Perfect! Now "Data-Man" is a comprehensive healthcare integration learning game. Here's what I've added to make it truly educational:

## ðŸŽ“ **Educational Features Added:**

### **1. Department-Specific Learning Content**
- **6 Hospital Departments** each with detailed integration challenges:
  - Emergency Department (real-time critical data)
  - ICU (continuous monitoring integration) 
  - Laboratory (test ordering and results)
  - Pharmacy (e-prescribing and drug interactions)
  - Radiology (DICOM and imaging workflows)
  - Surgery (OR scheduling and device integration)

### **2. Interactive Learning Modals**
- **Data Collection Learning**: Each data type collected shows specific integration concepts
- **Security Incident Education**: When hit by threats, players learn about real cybersecurity risks
- **Department Completion**: Summarizes integration challenges overcome
- **Security Protocol Activation**: Explains authentication and encryption concepts

### **3. Visual Learning Elements**
- **Different Data Types**: Each department has 4 specific data types with unique shapes/colors
- **Real Data Labels**: Abbreviated labels on data points (e.g., "TR" for Triage Data)
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows which data types have been collected and learned about
- **Threat Education**: Security threats labeled with real names (Malware, Phishing, etc.)

### **4. Real-World Integration Concepts**
- **HL7 Standards**: Mentions specific message types (ADT, ORM, ORU)
- **DICOM for Imaging**: Radiology-specific protocols
- **FHIR APIs**: Modern interoperability standards
- **Security Protocols**: Real authentication and encryption concepts
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Actual regulatory requirements

### **5. Learning Progression**
- **Department Introductions**: Each level starts with integration context
- **Data Type Education**: Learn about specific healthcare data flows
- **Challenge Summary**: Understand real-world integration obstacles
- **Best Practices**: Tips based on actual healthcare IT implementations

## ðŸ§  **What Players Actually Learn:**

1. **Healthcare Data Types**: Triage data, lab results, medication orders, imaging studies
2. **Integration Standards**: HL7 v2.x, FHIR, DICOM
3. **Security Threats**: Real cybersecurity risks specific to healthcare
4. **Workflow Understanding**: How different departments depend on data integration
5. **Compliance Requirements**: HIPAA implications of integration failures
6. **Technical Challenges**: Interoperability, real-time processing, alert management

Now when players collect data or encounter threats, they get popup learning modules with actual healthcare integration knowledge they can apply in real-world scenarios!
