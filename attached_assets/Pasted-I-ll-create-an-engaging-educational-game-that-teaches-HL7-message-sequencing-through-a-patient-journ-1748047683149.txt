I'll create an engaging educational game that teaches HL7 message sequencing through a patient journey scenario. This will help healthcare professionals understand the flow of clinical data integration.

I've created an engaging HL7 Message Sequencing Game that combines education with gamification! Here are the key features:

## Game Features:

üéØ **Patient Journey Scenarios**: Two realistic hospital scenarios:
- Emergency Department admission with chest pain
- Surgical procedure workflow

‚è∞ **60-Second Timer**: Creates urgency and engagement

üß© **Drag-and-Drop Style Interface**: Players select HL7 messages from a "cabinet" and place them in correct sequence

üèÜ **Scoring System**: Points for correct sequences plus time bonuses

## Educational Value:

- **Real HL7 Messages**: Uses actual HL7 message types (ADT^A04 for registration, ORM^O01 for orders, etc.)
- **Clinical Context**: Each message includes descriptions of what it does in clinical workflow
- **Progressive Learning**: Multiple scenarios with increasing complexity

## Game Mechanics:

1. **Start**: Player clicks "Start Game" to begin 60-second timer
2. **Select**: Click HL7 messages from the cabinet to place in sequence
3. **Arrange**: Messages appear in numbered slots (1, 2, 3, 4)
4. **Remove**: Click placed messages to remove and rearrange
5. **Submit**: "Check Sequence" button appears when all slots filled
6. **Results**: Immediate feedback with correct/incorrect highlighting

## Design Elements:

- **Clean Interface**: Follows the HIT design system from your documentation
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded results (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Clear typography and high contrast colors

The game effectively teaches the critical concept that **order matters** in clinical data integration - just like in real patient care workflows, HL7 messages must flow in the correct sequence for proper system integration!

Would you like me to add more scenarios, different difficulty levels, or modify any specific aspects of the game?
